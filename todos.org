** DONE use tag from release when building docker image
** DONE publish docker image on release
** DONE action.yml that uses docker image

** DONE allow additional args to be provided
** DONE workflow for changes to wiki
** TODO workflow for changes to ~docs/~
** DONE ability to use custom docker image?

* ~markasten tags~
** TODO scrape tags from yaml frontmatter, rather than backlinks
e.g:
#+begin_src markdown
---
tags:
- foo
- bar
---
#+end_src
this should render in a horizontal table in github
see [[https://github.blog/2013-09-27-viewing-yaml-metadata-in-your-documents/][here]] for more information
** TODO text in backquotes not in a tags header should not be scraped
latest commit doesn't seem to have fixed this for some reason
** TODO include other tags along with title in list of files per tag
e.g:
#+begin_src markdown
# Index
## Tag X
- [File title](path/to/file.md) `tag-y`

## Tag Y
- [File title](path/to/file.md) `tag-x`
#+end_src
